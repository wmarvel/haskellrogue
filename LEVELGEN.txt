For level generation:

Two pieces - First generate a fully connected level with rooms, then remove most
dead ends.

Generate a fully connected level with rooms:
1) Generate a perfect maze the size of the level
2) Randomly place rooms into the level
   - This will disconnect pieces of the perfect maze.
4) Pick any starting floor tile
5) Generate a floodfill from that floor tile and mark floor and door tiles as
   being in our region.
6) If there are no floor tiles left that are *not* in the region, we are done
   with this part of level generation.
7) Mark Wall tiles that meet the following criteria as replacable:
   - Have two or more floor tiles adjacent
   - Have exactly one of those tiles adjacent to the flooded region
   - are not on the edge of the world
   - Can this be done while flooding? probably.
8) Replace at least one Wall tile that is marked as replacable with floor or
a door, then go back to step 5.

Remove (most?) dead ends:
1) Get dead end tiles to be removed.
   - A dead end is a floor tile with three adjacent Wall tiles
   - To not remove them all we just randomly filter them with some probability
     here
2) For each dead end tile, replace with a wall. Check the adjacent floor tile
   to see if it has become a dead end, if so, that tile becomes a dead end to
   remove in the next pass.
3) when there are dead ends to remove, we are done.


This should leave us with a level that has all rooms connected, and if we select
more than one Wall to remove during the removing-walls loop, we will no longer
be perfectly connected but have loops in the paths.
