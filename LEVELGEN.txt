For level generation:

Generate a fully connected maze level with rooms:
1) Create a grid and place the floor area of the rooms 
2) Start a maze generator in the grid and repeat until there are no nodes
   that are not either part of a room or part of the maze. The maze generation
   algorithm will naturally leave walls around the room floors.
3) Connect the rooms to the maze. This may or may not fully connect the level
4) Pick any starting node and get the list of nodes that are reachable from
   that node.
5) If all nodes are reachable, this portion of level generation is complete,
   otherwise, connect a node that is adjacent to an unconnected node and loop
   back to step 4.

Remove dead ends:
1) Get dead end tiles to be removed. 
   - A dead end is a floor tile with three adjacent Wall tiles
   - To not remove them all we just randomly filter them with some probability
     here
2) For each dead end tile, replace with a wall.
3) If there are deadends left to remove, go back to step 1.
4) All deadends have been filled. 

This should leave us with a level that has all rooms connected, and if we select
more than one place to connect when reconnecting either rooms or the full
maze, there will naturally be loops in the level.
